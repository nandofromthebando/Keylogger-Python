### Description
A simple key logger written in Python, saves all the information in a file named "info.txt" in the same folder that you run the script in. Gives the ability to email logged info after specific time, "wait_time" is in seconds. Still a work in progress may need to adjust setting depending on OS. With a few configuration tweaks this does work.
